# Evolutionary Computation

## Overview
Evolutionary computation is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves the use of algorithms inspired by the principles of natural evolution. It encompasses a range of techniques and methodologies that draw on concepts such as natural selection, mutation, and genetic inheritance to solve optimization and search problems. This repository offers selection methods that contains the key components of evolutionary computation: Population, Fitness Function, Selection, Crossover (Recombination), Mutation, and Replacement. 

Also, the repository contains the Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm, a probabilistic technique used for solving computational problems that can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. It is inspired by the behavior of real ants in finding shortest paths from their colony to a food source. ACO is particularly effective for discrete optimization problems, where the goal is to find an optimal ordering or selection of elements.

## Content
This repository contains Python scripts covering:
- Sorting algorithms
- Search algorithms
- Data structures like trees, graphs, and linked lists
- And more

Each script is documented for ease of understanding and practical application.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/EdoMg2/PyStructAlgo.git
2. Navigate to the script of interest and run it using Python.
## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
